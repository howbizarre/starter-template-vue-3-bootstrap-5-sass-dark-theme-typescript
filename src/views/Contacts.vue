          <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Access to contacts has long been a feature available within native applications. The Contacts Picker API brings that functionality to web applications.</p>
          <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Use cases include selecting contacts to message via an email or chat application, selecting a contacts phone number for use with voice over IP (VOIP), or for discovering contacts who have already joined a social platform. User agents can also offer a consistent experience with other applications on a users device.</p>
